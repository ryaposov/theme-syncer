## Why

Some web apps have full light/dark theme support, but don't allow you to sync it with OS for some reason. The goal of this browser extension is to make the website keep the theme in sync with OS settings.

## Supported web apps

* Twitter.com
* Slack.com
* Coderslang.com
* ~~Notion~~ (theme sync is supported now)

## How to install

Only Chrome Browser is currently supported. Also works in Safari, but requires too many hacks. For Chrome:

* Clone/download this repository and place it somewhere where you keep you applications installed
* Open `chrome://extensions`
* Toggle "Developer Mode" on in the top right corner
* Click "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner and select folder of downloaded repository
* Click "Details" button on the installed extension in the list and make sure you have "Automatically allow access on the following sites" on
* Done! Now Slack (or other supported website) opened in Chrome tab will sync the color theme with your system.
