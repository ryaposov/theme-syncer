## Why

Some web apps have full light/dark theme support, but don't allow you to sync it with OS for some reason. The goal of this browser extension is to make the website keep the theme in sync with OS settings.

## Supported web apps

* Twitter.com
* Slack.com
* Coderslang.com
* ~~Notion~~ (theme sync is supported now)
